# Crossword Helper - README

## Project Introduction

### Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a **crossword helper** that enhances the solving experience by providing additional hints and clues. Initially, the tool assumes the user has access to the correct answers, but the ultimate objective is to create a model that can assist without this assumption. Furthermore, a separate **computer vision component** is being developed, allowing users to **capture an image of a crossword puzzle** and request hints for specific clues where needed. For now, the core functionality operates based on **clue/answer pairs** as input.

### Data
The primary dataset for this project consists of **New York Times (NYT) crossword data spanning from 1993 to 2021**. Each entry includes:
- **Timestamp** (date of the crossword puzzle)
- **Clue** (the prompt provided in the puzzle)
- **Answer** (the correct solution)

The dataset serves as the foundation for training models that generate helpful hints, classify answers and clues, and enhance the crossword-solving experience.

## ML/Deep Learning Approach

This project explores several machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to generate hints with varying levels of complexity:

### 1. Synonyms, Related Words, and Antonyms (Word Embeddings & Thesaurus-based Methods)
- **Approach**: This method aims to retrieve **synonyms, related words, and antonyms** for a given answer.
- **Technique**:
  - Utilize **word embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText) to find words with similar vector representations.
  - Use **WordNet** or other thesaurus-based APIs to fetch synonyms and antonyms.
- **Purpose**: Helps users recognize variations of an answer, aiding them in thinking through different possibilities.

### 2. Answer Classification (Supervised Learning)
- **Approach**: This involves **categorizing answers** into predefined classes, helping users determine the *type* of word they should be considering.
- **Technique**:
  - Use **pre-trained language models** (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) fine-tuned on crossword datasets.
  - Train a **supervised classifier** (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, or neural networks) using labeled examples.
  - Possible categories: **Proper Noun, Verb, Adjective, Common Phrase, Scientific Term, etc.**
- **Purpose**: Guides the user toward the nature of the answer, improving the problem-solving process.

### 3. Clue Classification (Supervised Learning)
- **Approach**: This method classifies **clues** into various categories, informing users about the kind of hint they are receiving.
- **Technique**:
  - Utilize **TF-IDF and machine learning classifiers** (e.g., Naive Bayes, Random Forest, or BERT-based transformers) to categorize clues.
  - Categories could include: **Anagram, Definition-based, Homophone, Cryptic, Wordplay, Pop Culture Reference, etc.**
- **Purpose**: Assists users by setting expectations about how to interpret the given clue.


### 4. Answer Prediction (Fine-Tuning T5)

- **Approach**: This method aims to predict the correct answer for a given clue, even without access to the solution, by training a sequence-to-sequence model.
- **Technique**:
  - Fine-tune **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** on the crossword dataset where the input is the clue, and the target output is the correct answer.
  - Utilize **tokenization and data preprocessing** techniques to ensure effective model learning.
  - Train with **cross-entropy loss** and optimize using **AdamW** to handle the large vocabulary space.
  - Experiment with **beam search** or **top-k sampling** for generating better answer predictions.
- **Purpose**: Enables the crossword helper to **suggest possible answers** when the user does not know the correct solution, moving towards a fully independent crossword-solving AI.

### 5. Additional Hint Generation (Transformer-Based NLP Model)
- **Approach**: This method involves **generating new hints** that provide a fresh perspective on the answer.
- **Technique**:
  - Fine-tune a **transformer model** (e.g., GPT, T5, or BART) on the crossword dataset to generate alternative hints.
  - Use **data augmentation** techniques to improve training diversity.
  - Explore **reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)** to refine hint quality.
- **Purpose**: Gives users more ways to think about the answer, increasing their chances of solving the puzzle without direct spoilers.

## Future Goals
- **Eliminate the need for correct answers** by developing **automated crossword-solving AI**.
- **Expand the dataset** beyond NYT crosswords to include additional sources for better generalization.
- **Enhance computer vision capabilities** to process hand-written or printed crossword puzzles efficiently.
- **Refine hint-generation algorithms** to provide more natural and helpful hints based on user preferences.

## Conclusion
This project blends **machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing** to create an intelligent crossword-solving assistant. With future advancements, the tool aims to function independently without requiring direct access to the answers, making crossword puzzles more accessible and enjoyable for all users.

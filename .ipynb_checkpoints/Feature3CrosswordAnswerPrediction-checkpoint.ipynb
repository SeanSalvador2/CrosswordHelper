    "## Brainstorm/Outline\n",
    "- Goal is to fine-tune a base model LLM to predict crossword answers using Hint **and** Answer Length.\n",
    "    - Also would like to try building a NN from scratch, but compute resources are an issue.  \n",
    "- One Future Idea:\n",
    "    - Utilize hint classification: Separate Hints by type.\n",
    "        - ie.) Use a masked language model for fill in the blank hints.\n",
    "        - ie.) Train separate model for understanding puns, anagrams, wordplay, cryptic clues\n",
    "- What type of NLP task is this?\n",
    "    - This is Text2Text Generation. We have an input --> output format. We want the model to generate text based on the input.\n",
    "- What base model are we using for fine-tuning? **Google's t5-base**\n",
    "    -  Full name + Creator: T5 Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer. Made by google.\n",
    "    -  Key Characteristics\n",
    "        - Treats every NLP task as a text-to-text problem. Both the input and output are texts, regardless of task.\n",
    "            - Text-to-Text Transfer: A model that converts one piece of text into another for any NLP task.\n",
    "        - Based on Transfer Learning.\n",
    "            - Transfer Learning: Allows a model to leverage learned from one task/domain to improve performance on other.\n",
    "            - Analogy:\n",
    "                - Imagine a person who already speaks Spanish learning Italian. Since the languages are similar, they can learn faster compared to someone starting from zero.\n",
    "                -  Similarly, T5 has already learned about words, sentence structure, and general knowledge, so it adapts to crosswords faster than a randomly initialized model.\n",
    "        - Archtiecture: Sequence-to-Sequence (Encoder-Decoder Transformer).\n",
    "            - A model where an input sequence is mapped to an output sequence. Useful for when input and outputs are variable lengths.\n",
    "            - Encoder: Reads input (clue), converts it to some meaningful numerical representation.\n",
    "            - Decoder: Uses that information to generate the correct answer one token at a time.\n",
    "        - Pre-trained on massive dataset (the C4 Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus), meaning it already has built-in knowledge. Knows general facts, common words. Understands word relationships, synonyms and meaning. Understands grammar, sentence structure and phrasing\n",
    "    - How was it trained?\n",
    "        - Instead of predicting single masked tokens (like BERT), T5 masks entire spans/chunks of words and asks models to reconstruct the,  \n",
    "    -  Why is it useful for answer prediction?\n",
    "        - Understand clues by encoding them into a numerical representation.  \n",
    "        - It's text-to-text approach ensures we aren't just choosing/classifying from predefined answer - model actually learns to generate the correct words based on patterns it has seen.\n",
    "        - Pretraining on large data helps it understand word relationships, trivia and definitions.\n",
    "    - Drawbacks/Cons:\n",
    "        - Requires more compute than basic shallow learning classification models.\n",
    "        - Generative aspect means it may hallucinate/make up stuff.\n",
    "        - Does not have up-to-date knowledge. C4 datasets stops at 2019/2020.\n",
    "        - Does not store facts directly/have explicity world knowledge like a database.\n",
    "        - Does not inherently understand wordplay or anagrams.\n",
    "- General approach\n",
    "    - Fine-tune the model on crossword answers.\n",
    "    - Generate multiple answer using **Beam Search** to produce diverse, high-quality alternative answers. Also could use top-k sampling for more diversity/randomness.\n",
    "        - Necessary so we can match answer length.\n",
    "        - How beam search works: Instead of greedily picking best answer at all steps, Beam Search keeps track of multiple possible output and ranks them. Keeps the top beam_size candidates at each step.\n",
    "    - Filter answer candiadtes by length to ensure predicted output actually matches the crossword answer length. \n"

    "    - What is it?  A structured dataset format used by the Hugging Face `datasets` library, optimized for efficient tokenization and training.  \n",
    "    - Why?  It allows for easy preprocessing, batching, and integration with Hugging Face’s `Trainer` API, making training faster and more memory-efficient.  \n",
    "    - Hugging Face .map() function: apply a transformation to every example in a dataset. It is highly efficient because it supports batch processing, multiprocessing, and in-place modifications."
